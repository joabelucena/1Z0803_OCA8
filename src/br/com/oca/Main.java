 * This repository was created for studying to OCA SE8 Exam.
 * 
 * Here are the topics that will be studied in this 'course'
 * 
 * 1 Java Basics
 * 
 * 		1.1 Define the scope of variables 
 * 		1.2 Define the structure of a Java class
 * 		1.3 Create executable Java applications with a main method; run a Java program from the command line; including console output.
 * 		1.4 Import other Java packages to make them accessible in your code
 * 		1.5 Compare and contrast the features and components of Java such as: platform independence, object orientation, encapsulation, etc.
 * 
 * 2 Working With Java Data Types
 *  
 * 		2.1 Declare and initialize variables (including casting of primitive data types)
 * 		2.2 Differentiate between object reference variables and primitive variables
 * 		2.3 Know how to read or write to object fields
 * 		2.4 Explain an Object's Lifecycle (creation, "dereference by reassignment" and garbage collection)
 * 		2.5 Develop code that uses wrapper classes such as Boolean, Double, and Integer.  
 *
 * 3 Using Operators and Decision Constructs
 *  
 * 		3.1 Use Java operators; including parentheses to override operator precedence
 * 		3.2 Test equality between Strings and other objects using == and equals ()
 * 		3.3 Create if and if/else and ternary constructs 
 * 		3.4 Use a switch statement 
 * 
 * 4 Creating and Using Arrays
 *  
 * 		4.1 Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a one-dimensional array
 * 		4.2 Declare, instantiate, initialize and use multi-dimensional array
 * 
 * 5 Using Loop Constructs
 *  
 * 		5.1 Create and use while loops
 * 		5.2 Create and use for loops including the enhanced for loop
 * 		5.3 Create and use do/while loops
 * 		5.4 Compare loop constructs
 * 		5.5 Use break and continue  
 * 
 * 6 Working with Methods and Encapsulation
 *  
 * 		6.1 Create methods with arguments and return values; including overloaded methods
 * 		6.2 Apply the static keyword  to methods and fields  
 * 		6.3 Create and overload constructors; including impact on default constructors
 * 		6.4 Apply access modifiers
 * 		6.5 Apply encapsulation principles to a class
 * 		6.6 Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed  into methods that change the values
 * 
 * 7 Working with Inheritance
 *  
 * 		7.1 Describe inheritance and its benefits
 * 		7.2 Develop code that demonstrates the use of polymorphism; including overriding and object type versus reference type
 * 		7.3 Determine when casting is necessary
 * 		7.4 Use super and this to access objects and constructors
 * 		7.5 Use abstract classes and interfaces
 * 
 * 8 Handling Exceptions
 *  
 * 		8.1 Differentiate among checked exceptions, unchecked exceptions, and Errors
 * 		8.2 Create a try-catch block and determine how exceptions alter normal program flow
 * 		8.3 Describe the advantages of Exception handling 
 * 		8.4 Create and invoke a method that throws an exception
 * 		8.5 "Recognize common exception classes (such as NullPointerException, ArithmeticExcpetion, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ClassCastException)"
 * 
 * 9 Working with Selected classes from the Java API
 *  
 * 		9.1 Manipulate data using the StringBuilder class and its methods
 * 		9.2 Creating and manipulating Strings
 * 		9.3 Create and manipulate calendar data using classes from java.time.LocalDateTime,  java.time.LocalDate, java.time.LocalTime, java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter, java.time.Period 
 * 		9.4 Declare and use an ArrayList of a given type 
 * 		9.5 Write a simple Lambda expression that consumes a Lambda Predicate expression
